The module implements classes & functions to identify the category an image belongs to.

- ObjectClassification.py

    INPUTS:
    - An image representing a frame of a video.
    - Number of objects identified.
    - 4 lists that are output from ObjectMapping module and that represent the rectangles
        around each object in image.

    INTERMEDIATE PROCESS:
    - The image is scaled to 400 by 400 pixels.
    - Parents' object categories are classified to check if they are human, animal or a thing.
    - Sub-Objects are classified to further classify humans, animals and things. (WILL BE
        IMPLEMENTED AT A LATER STAGE).

    FUNCTIONS:

        map0bjects():
            Inputs: None
            Outputs: None
            Process: Populates 4 lists containing information about rectangles and calculates
                    value of 'n'. Main function that runs the algorithm responsible for
                    detecting objects.

        getNumberOfObjects():
            Inputs: None
            Outputs: Number of Objects identified in image
            Process: None

        getObjects:
            Inputs: None
            Outputs: 4 lists containing information about rectangles.
            Process: None


    ALGORITHMS:
        - Bag of Words:
            In order to detect whether we have a human, animal or object we can use Bag of Words
            algorithm whose code can be found here. The algorithm makes use of LinearSVC and
            other machine learning tools to determine the kind of object.
            The Python implementation using sklearn and openCV can be found here:
