The module implements classes & functions to map objects in an image.

- ObjectMapping.py

    INPUTS:
    - An image representing a frame of a video.

    INTERMEDIATE PROCESS:
    - The image is scaled to 400 by 400 pixels.
    - Relevant objects are mapped.
    - 4 lists are populated. First list contains starting x-cordingates of each rectangle
        around mapped objects. Second list contains y-cordinates of each rectangle. Third
        list contains widths of rectangles formed around each mapped object. Fourth list
        contains heights of rectangles formed around each mapped object.

    FUNCTIONS:

        map0bjects():
            Inputs: None
            Outputs: None
            Process: Populates 4 lists containing information about rectangles and calculates
                    value of 'n'. Main function that runs the algorithm responsible for
                    detecting objects.

        getNumberOfObjects():
            Inputs: None
            Outputs: Number of Objects identified in image
            Process: None

        getObjects:
            Inputs: None
            Outputs: 4 lists containing information about rectangles.
            Process: None
